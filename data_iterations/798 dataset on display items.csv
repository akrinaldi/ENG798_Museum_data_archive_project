Mr. Helmick made it a promised gift to the Hirshhorn (this was during Jim Demetrion's tenure) but when Helmick died in 2003, the Hirshhorn decided against buying out his estate's interest and the work became available for sale.  At that point it was purchased by Alexander and Bonin, the gallery which represents the Thek estate, and has been in the gallery's holdings ever since. 

According to Ted Bonin, the fingers have been twice repaired: the first repair was done by the conservation department of the Des Moines Art Center, where the piece was stored for a period in the 1980s or 90s; and the second was performed in 2007 by Christian Scheidemann (a well known German conservator who wrote a major essay on conservation issues related to Thek's Fishman in 1996) at the request of Alexander and Bonin.",sculpture,Person,"Thek, Paul",,American,1/1/33,1/1/88,"Brooklyn, New York","New York City (New York state, United States)"

[1]. See Knoedler Archive, The Getty Research Institute, London stock book, 1919. The sitter, Deborah Winchester, married Sir Edward Dering, 6th Bt. in 1765 (his second wife). The painting likely descended through the Dering family to Sir Henry E. Dering. Theodore Allen Heinrich, Director of the Royal Ontario Museum, in June 1956 correspondence in the museum donor files, also mentions that the painting was in the collection of Sir Henry Dering, 10th Bt.
[2]. Knoedler owned 1/2 share of the painting with Colnaghi. See Knoedler London stock no. 6587; Knoedler New York stock no. 14831.

Notes:
[1]. Edward R. Bacon spent considerable time abroad, especially in Paris and London. It's possible that he acquired this painting during his travels. During this period, his primary residence was in New York City, however, where he made his home at 247 Fifth Avenue with his brother and sister-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Rathbone Bacon (see note 2.) Edward R. Bacon bequeathed his art collection to his brother; the residue of the estate was shared equally by his brother and sister-in-law. The painting is no. 105 in the ""Memorial Catalogue of Paintings by Old and Modern Masters Collected by Edward R. Bacon,"" privately printed for Virginia P. Bacon, New York, 1919.
[2]. Mr. and Mrs. Walter Rathbone Bacon's primary residence was in New York City (see note 1.) Though they maintained an estate in Turriff, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, they were not able to travel there after the outbreak of World War I.

Notes:
[1]. Previous references in the literature regarding the early provenance of this painting included the Marquis d'Effiat [-1632], Chateau de Chilly, France, 1630 until 1632, Madame du Barry [1743-1793], Versailles, France, and the sale of her collection in Paris in 1777.  However, the description of the relevant lot in the du Barry sale matches the Vouet Cincinnati painting of the subject rather than this work. So, that early provenance likely belongs with the Cincinnati picture. See curatorial file for a copy of the 1777 auction catalogue from the Frick Library and Pierre Rosenberg's entry on the CMOA painting in ""France in the Golden Age"", The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1982, no. 122, p. 340.
[2]. Sale entitled ""Tableaux Anciens des ma√Ætres fran√ßais du XVIIIe si√®cle"". Sold for 660 francs, as per Pierre Rosenberg reference given in [1].
[3]. Sale entitled ""Tableaux Anciens des √©coles Fran√ßaise, Flamande et Hollandaise"". The Pierre Rosenberg reference referes to Jean-Paul Mazaroz-Ribalier as ""fabricant de meubles d'art"".
[4]. See curatorial file for date of acquisition by Cassatt, which is given in references as 1904 or ""around 1905"". The date that the painting came into the pocession of her brother J. Gardner Cassatt is also given variously as 1904, 1905, or 1906.
[5]. See correspondence with Ellen Mary Hare (Mrs. Horace Binney Hare) in curatorial file regarding the history of the painting in the Cassatt family.  Mrs. Hare wrote that the painting ""was bought by my Aunt - Miss Cassatt about 1904 for my father & hung in our drawing room for many years-/ Our house having been sold - we no longer have room to hang it and I wondered if the Carnegie Institute would be interested in it as a gift?""

[3]. Mrs. Joseph Urban (Mary Porter Beegle Urban.) Mrs. Urban is listed as a lender to the 1959 Klimt exhibition at Galerie St. Etienne in New York City, where the painting was included and illustrated in the catalogue. Information from Jane Kallir and Hildegard Bachert of Galerie St. Etienne (specifically e-mails reporting on conversations with them, dated May-June 2003) confirms the descent of the painting in the Urban family, specifically his widow, who sold it to the gallery after the 1959 Klimt exhibition there.
[4]. Galerie St. Etienne (Otto Kallir) sent the painting to the museum on approval sometime in late 1959, likely in December 1959.

This work then appears on page 126, plate 28, of ""Choix de gravures √† l'eau-forte d'apr√®s les peintures et les marbres de la galerie de Lucien Bonaparte"", published in 1812. It is then listed for sale in Bonaparte's auction on Febuary 6. 1815. [4] Bought in. [5] Because this work was bought in at the Bonaparte sale in 1815, in 1816 it appears in the ""Catalogue of the Splendid Collection of Pictures Belonging to Lucien Buonaparte, Prince of Canino"". It advertises an exhibition of works ""Now on private view at Chevalier Boyer's, No. 31 Leicester Square, London."" Inside is a disclosure that ""Proposals for the Purchase of any of the Pictures in this Collection are to be made to the Chevalier Boyer, nephew of Lucien Buonaparte, Prince of Canino, at No. 31 Leicester Square."" This work is listed as no. 80,  ""St. Augustine"" on page 22. The sale occurred on May 14-16, 1816. [6] This sale was entitled ""The beautiful, choice, and truly valuable collection of pictures, the property of Christian William Huybens, a bankrupt; comprising unusually fine specimens of the greatest masters of the Florentine, Roman, Venetian, Lombard, and Bolognese schools, with many exquiste bijoux of the renowned and highly coveted painters of Flanders and Holland"", and sold for ¬£68.5 according to the Getty Provenance Index. [7] his work was bought for Dfl 2,825. See ""'A small but choice collection'; the Art Gallery of King Willem II of the Netherlands"" by Hinterding and Horsch, pg. 108. [8] See Hinterding and Horsch, pg. 10. This work is recorded as being purchased by Nieuwenhuys in July of 1823, and then sold to King Willem II sometime after. [9] This work is bought in at this sale, failing to reach its reserve of Dfl. 8,000, only reaching Dfl. 7,400. See Hinterding and Horsch, pg 108. [10] Hinterding and Horsch list this work as being sold for Dfl. 6,000 to ""Weimar (art dealer) for Prince Hendrik"", referring to [11] Prince Hendrik, or Prince Willem Frederik Hendrik was the 3rd son of King Willem II of the Netherlands, and third in line for the throne. By 1850, Prince Hendrik was serving as Governor of Luxembourg, a post he served in until his death. [12] Grand Duchess Sophie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach was the daughter of King Willem II, and the sister of Prince Hendrik. She married her first cousin, Karl Alexander August Johann, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, also known as Charles Alexander. [13] It is likely that this work descended to Willhelm Ernst through his grandfather, Grand Duke Charles Alexander, the spouse of Grand Duchess Sophie. When Grand Duke Charles Alexander died in 1901, Willhelm Ernst succeeded him as Grand Duke. This work is recorded as being in the possession of the ""Grand Duke, Weimar"" on page 191 in Bombe, ""Perugino: Des Meisters Gem√§lde"", written in 1914, so we know that it was with Willhelm Ernst at this point during his reign as Grand Duke. It then appears again in Umberto Gnoli's ""Pietro Perugino"", 1923, page 68, where the location is recorded as Weimar, and the ""Castello"" [14] This work is recorded as being in ""Schlossmuseum Weimar"" in Fritz Knapp ""Perugino"", 1926, and is number 69 in the book. Following the abdication of Grand Duke Wilhem Ernst in 1923, the title of Grand Duke was abolished, and the Schloss Weimar was turned in to a museum. [15] Weininger lent this work to the Royal Academy, London, for their exhibition on Italian Art from 1200-1900, which ran from January 1 until March 20, 1930. It appears on page 208 of the exhibition catalog, number 370, as ""St. Augustine"".

Notes:
[1]. In 1809, Lebrun published an engraving of the portrait as by Raphael (plate no. 40) as part of a collection formed during trips in 1807 and1808. 
[2].  Sir Thomas Baring likely acquired the painting through Mr. Harris, Bond Street, London who received many of the Lebrun pictures on consignment. See information on its early provenance and attribution in various sources, including W. Buchanan, ""Memoirs of Painting"", London, 1824 (p. 254, as by Raphael) and ""A Descriptive Catalogue of the Collection of Pictures Belonging to the Earl of Northbrook"", 1889, no. 211 (as by Andrea del Sarto). 
[3]. As stated in the Introduction of ""A Descriptive Catalogue of the Collection of Pictures Belonging to the Earl of Northbrook"", 1889: ""In 1848, on the death of Sir Thomas Baring, his collection was sold in accordance with his will; and the Italian, Spanish, and French pictures were bought at a valuation by Mr. Baring."" Waagen in Vol. 2 of ""Treasures"" published in 1854, describes the picture in Mr. Baring's collection and attributes it to Pontormo (p. 176).
[4]. Bernard Berenson attributes the picture to Franciabigio in 1896 and 1909 editions of ""Florentine Painters of the Renaissance"" and so does Venturi in ""Storia dell' Arte Italiana"" (1925, p. 452).  All three publications still refer to the painting as being in the Northbrook collection.
[5]. Listed and illustrated as by Raphael under section ""The Property of a Gentleman"" of the sale entitled ""Pictures and Drawings by Old Masters""; several other pictures in that section were also part of the Northbrook collection, so, perhaps, the ""Gentleman"" referred to was the Earl himself (though he died in 1929) or someone else who bought a number of the pictures and resold them at this auction. Bought by Asscher for ¬£500 (see copy of annotated catalogue from the Frick Library in the curatorial file).

NOTES:
[1]. The information is from entry no. 5 in the 1889 catalogue of the Earl of Northbrook collection. It refers, most likely, to noted collector and dealer C. J. Nieuwenhuys [1799-1883], Brussels and London. 
[2]. As by Bernard Van Orley. 
[3]. In the 1889 catalogue of the Earl of Northbrook collection, this work, no. 5, is simply listed under the ""Early Netherlandish School"" section, with the following footnote: ""A similar picture was, in 1860, in the collection of the Rev. Mr. Heath, Vicar of Enfield."" 
[4]. The Earl lent it to the Royal Academy Exhibition of Flemish and Dutch art in 1927. 
[5]. Photo, no. R 770. Information from a copy of the firm's inventory records at the Getty Research Institute. The record for this painting lists the source as ""Sarasota N 248"", which may suggest a connection with John Ringling with whom the B√∂hler firm had a long and close relationship.

Notes:
[1.] Bernal's collection was sold in a series of auctions beginning on March 5, 1855.  This lot was part of the eighth sale on March 13, 1855, as ""School of Georgione"", ""The Chevalier Bayard"";
[2]. The Frick Photoarchive record for this work states that at the Bernal sale it was ""bought by Morant, for ¬£22.11.6"".
[3]. It is unclear whether the ownership of the painting involved one or two generations of the Ramsden family, that is Sir John William Ramsden, 5th Baronet [1831-1914] and/or Sir John Frecheville Ramsden, 6th Baronet [1877-1958].

Walter Feilchenfeldt in ""Vincent van Gogh, The Years in France"" (English edition published by Philip Wilson Publishers, London, 2013), gives an alternate early provenance beginning with Theo van Gogh, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, and V. W. van Gogh. This is probably because he identifies this work as no. 47 (""Au Moulin de la Galette"") on the Andries Bonger list. See the reference for a discussion of the origin and uncertainties of this list.

[3]. Heir of Andries Bonger's first wife, Annie Bonger-van der Linden. The middle initial of this owner is in some doubt.  The reference from the Van Gogh Museum given above gives it as ""H.‚Äù and Walter Feilchenfeldt as ‚ÄúL.‚Äù Also, the van Gogh Museum reference lists only one heir as recipient of the gift under the painting's catalogue entry (no. 89, p. 120), but in the text  (p. 83)  the painting is referred to as a gift to ""C.

NOTES: [1] See Prachoff, 1904, ""Les Tresors d'Art en Russie"", pg. 53-56. On page 56, Prachoff writes ""A la fin de l'ouvrage vou√© √† Clodion par Thirion (Les Adam et Clodion, Paris, 1885) ets annex√©e une liste des oeuvres de Clodion qui on apparu aux ventes de 1767 √† 1884- L'auteur parle entre autre d'une terre-cuite d'une ¬´petit mod√©le de la Vestale faite pour L'Imp√©ratrice Catherine de Russie¬ª..""  [2] This work is listed as by ""Claudion"" and is described as ""Une vestale en terre cuite, petit modele de la figure que cet artiste a ex√©cute en marbre pour l'Im√©ratrice de Russie."" This is consistent with the idea that Clodion executed this terracotta work in preparation for the marble Vestal for Catherine II. [3] Purchased for 245 livres, according to the Getty Provenance Index record for this sale. Lebrun's wife, the painter Louise √âlisabeth Vig√©e Le Brun, painted the granddaughters of Catherine II, and was supposed to paint Catherine II's portrait, but the monarch died before before the sitting happened. [4] This sale happened at No. 95, rue de Cl√©ry, Paris, France. This work is listed as ""Une Vestale voil√©e et couronn√©e de fleurs, tenant de la main droit une pat√©re, et de la gauche un vase. Pr√©s d'elle est plac√© un trepied de forme antique. Cette belle terre cuite fut ex√©cut√©e avec √©tude recherch√©e par cet artiste, dont les productions de ce genre sont toujours pr√©cieuses aux amateurs de l'art.""  The height of this work is listed as ""Hauteur, 18 pounces; lageur 7 pouces"". These measurements match the museum's sculpture. [5] This name is recorded differently- in ""Notes Sur Clodion, Statuaire, A propos Du Cabinet D'un Amateur, Par F. De Villars"", pg 21, a person by the name ‚ÄúRadet‚Äù is said to have purchased the work 1791 Lebrun sale for 60 francs. The Getty Provenance Index also lists this name as ‚ÄúRadet‚Äù. However, annotated catalogs of this same sale from the Frick Art Reference Library and the French Institut national de histoire de l‚Äôart clearly record the name as ‚ÄúRadel‚Äù. [6] While the exact owner and purchase date is unclear, however we know the work was in the collection of the Stroganoff family by 1863, when it appears in a watercolor of the Stroganoff's library by Jules Mayblum. See ""Stroganoff: The Palace and Collections of a Russian Noble Family"", pg. 84, edited by Penelope Hunter-Stiebel. [7] Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, many private art collections, including that of the Stroganoff family, were nationalized. [8] This sale entitled ""Sammlung Stroganoff"", with this work sold as one of a pair listed as ""Zwei Terrakottastatuetten"" on pg, 232. This work sells as part of a pair with 68.33.2 for 9500 RM.The sale is being listed as ""Im auftrag der handelsvertretung der union der sozialistischen sowjet-republiken"". The auction catalog records the date of this sculpture as 1765, which is in error as the date signed on the sculpture is 1768.  [9] Sale entitled "" French modern paintings & drawings, eighteenth century French furniture, marble and terra cotta sculptures, bronze dor√© objects of art ...Collected by the late Thelma Chrysler Foy"", this work listed as  ""Nymphe et Vestale"" on page 94.

Notes: 
[1]. The artist was active in 1472; the year of his death is most often recorded as 1510. 
[2]. This information comes from correspondence with  Matteo Mazzalupi, see curatorial file. 
[3]. The work is recorded as being in Barker's collection in 1854 by the German art historian Gustav Friedrich Waagen. See Waagen, ""Treasures of Art in Great Britain"" 1854, v. II, page 128. 
[4]. Hall's Place, in Harbledown near Canterbury, was a country home that underwent several changes in ownership and had many residents. It is uncertain which individual or family purchased this work. 
[5]. George Richmond, R.A. attached a lengthy handwritten label found on the reverse of this work. On the label, he states that he purchased this work from Colnaghi and records the early provenance of the work. It is signed and dated G. R. December 4, 1885 and gives his address as 20 York Street, Portman Square W. Richmond lent the work to the 1881 Royal Academy exhibition, which opened on January 3, 1881 (no. 222, as Early Venetian, ""The Virgin and Child, and Four Saints."") 
[6]. Auction entitled ""Pictures of the Early English, Old Italian and Flemish Schools, Formed by the Late George Richmond, R.A. Also a selection from the Works of the Late George Richmond, R. A."" See copy of auction catalog and correspondence with Christie's, February-March 1971. 
[7] Annotated catalogues from the George Richmond, R.A. sale record Lesser as the buyer of this work. Lesser was a London art dealer. His sale to Vernon J. Watney is recorded in ""A Catalogue of Pictures and Miniatures At Cornbury and 11 Berkley Square, January 1915,"" which was compiled by ""V. J. W."" (Vernon J. Watney) on page 16:  ""Bought from Mr. L. Lesser, 1899."" It is unclear if Watney purchased this work from Lesser privately or through his gallery. 
[8] Vernon Watney's label was attached to the reverse of this work; it was recorded in his catalogue of artworks written in 1915, as noted in [7] above. The catalogue indicates that the Watney family also maintained art works in their residence in London.
[9] She is also referred to as Lady Margaret Wallop, not to be confused with her daughter, Lady Rosalind Margaret Watney. 
[10] Sale entitled ""Highly Important Pictures by Old Masters"" and listed as ""The Virgin and Child With Saints"". See catalogue, supplied to the museum by Christie's, in curatorial file. It contains a price list, which indicates that this work, lot 31, was bought by M. Creswell for 58000 Gns.",paintings,Person,Nicola di Maestro Antonio,,Italian,1425-01-01,1510-01-01,,

NOTES: [1] Between October of 1621 and September 1622, Cardinal Borghese made several entries in account books about issuing payment to Bernini and foundry man Bastiano Sebastiani for the creation, casting and transport of busts of Pope Paul V and Pope Gregory XV. These account books form part of the Borghese archive, now part of the Vatican Secret Archives. They were transcribed by Italo Faldi in the Appendix documents of ""Nuove note sul Bernini"", Bolletino d'Arte, XXXVIII, No. 4, October-December 1953. [2] The Ludovisi family likely owned this work prior to 1682, but we know for certain that it was in their possession in 1682. In Baldinucci, ""Vita del Cavaliere Gio Lorenzo Bernino"", 1682, pg 104, two busts of Gregory XV are listed under ""Ritratti, e teste con busto"", one as ""Di Gregorio XV"" and the other, directly below, as ""altro di metallo"" and bracketed together as being ""in casa Ludovisi."" The two busts appear together in Domenico Bernino's ""Vita del Cavlier Gio. Lorenzo Bernino"", 1713, pg. 22-23, where he writes that "" in marmo & in Metallo de'quali tr√© preferentemente se ne veggono nella Casa Ludovisi.""  In ""Ritratti di alcuni celebri pittori del secolo XVII"", Rome, 1731, pg. 140, the works are listed together again, however they are described as ""gi√† in Casa Ludovisi"". From these references, we infer that the bust left the possession of the Ludovisi between 1713 and 1731. [3] Records indicate that this work went to a ""Bolognese family related to the Ludovisi"" but does not clarify the family name or a specific member of the family. See correspondence from Wildenstein & Co. in curatorial file. [4] Antonio Mu√±oz records Stroganoff as having purchased this work from Corvisieri, an antiquarian in Rome. See Mu√±oz ""Un'opera del Bernini ritrovata,"" Vita d'Arte, Volume VIII, Number 48, December 1911, pg. 187-190.  Stroganoff's name is also recorded as Count or Comte Stroganov, and as Gregorio Stroganoff. [5] This work was likely sold or dispersed between 1916 and 1928, as it is recorded in 1916 as ""the fine bust of Gregory XV by Bernini, now in the Stroganoff collection."" by Mu√±oz, ""Studi sul Bernini,"" L'Arte, Vol. XIX, 1916, pg. 103-104. But in 1928, Mu√±oz reports that this work ""was formerly in the Stroganoff collection in Rome."" in ""Roma Barocca, 2nd ed., Milan, 1928, pg. 104-105. It was definitely out of the collection by 1938, when it is mentioned as ""A remarkable bronze bust of this pope remained in Rome until the Stroganoff collection was dispersed."" in T. H. Fokker, ""Roman Baroque Art"", Oxford, 1938, p. 137. [6] It is likely that Mu√±oz acquired this work significantly before 1953, but it is referenced as being in his collection in Faldi, ""Nuovo note sul Bernini,"" Bollettino d'Arte, XXXVIII, No. 4, October-December 1953, pg. 311-313. See translated clipping in curatorial file via Wildenstein & Co. Mu√±oz published a catalog of the collection of Gr√©goire Stroganoff in 1912 entitled ""Pi√®ces de Choix de la Collection du Comte Gr√©goire Stroganoff √° Rome"". A bust of Pope Gregory XV can be seen in a photograph of an interior room. Mu√±oz authored at least 7 articles about Bernini and this work. [7] Rudolph Wittkower records this sculpture as being ""Formerly Mu√±oz collection, Rome (Recently exported to U.S.A.)"" in his book ""Gian Lorenzo Bernini"", 2nd ed., 1966, pg. 180-181. Because of this note, we can assume that the work was out of Rome either in 1966 or before.",sculpture,Person,"Bernini, Gian Lorenzo",,Italian,1598-01-01,1680-01-01,"Naples (Napoli province, Campania, Italy)","Rome (Roma province, Lazio, Italy)"

Notes:
[1]. In England by the mid-19th century when restored by F. Leedham, who was active in London c.1830-1860. Possibly in the collection of Miss Rogers, London, England, by 1835 (see Waagen II, p. 269: ""Agnolo Bronzino. Portrait of Leonora di Toledo, wife of Cosimo I., Grand Duke of Tuscany; half the size of life. An admirable work, distinguished from most of the pictures by this master by the transparency and warmth of the flesh tones."") Miss Rogers (Sarah Rogers [1772-1855]) inherited the collection of her brother Henry Rogers in 1833 or 1834; however, she was also a collector herself. In turn, she left the majority of her collection to another brother the poet Samuel Rogers [1763-1855] at her death in January 1855. After his death in December 1855, his collection was sold at auction in April-May 1856 and included the Bronzino portrait (no. 683.)
[2]. It is not yet clear when and how the painting became part of the Huntington collection but it was in his possession by August 1900.
[3]. Collis P. Huntington, in his will, gave his collection of pictures to the Metropolitan Museum of Art with life interest to Arabella Huntington, his second wife and his adopted son, Archer M. Huntington. Arabella married Henry E. Huntington [1850-1927], who was the nephew of Collis P. Huntington, in July 1913. She is referred to as ""Mrs. Henry E. Huntington"" in documents after the marriage. 
[4]. Although life interest in this work was transferred to Archer Huntington from Arabella Huntington after her death, he terminated his life interest in 1925 and gave the work, among others in the original bequest, to the Metropolitan Museum. Specifically, this portrait was no. 36 among the paintings delivered to the Metropolitan Museum of Art from the Collis P. Huntington estate on April 30 and May 1, 1925 (see curatorial file.)
[5]. Metropolitan Museum accession number 25.110.131 (written in red paint on stretcher.)

[1]. As per inscription in the artist's hand on reverse.
[2]. Early provenance is according to ""American Paintings and Sculpture to 1945 in the Carnegie Museum of Art,"" pages 179-181 and ""The Beal Collection of American Art,"" page 90. Only Mrs. Carlsen is listed in the provenance of the painting in these references. However, according to a 1981 appraisal report from the Art Dealers Association of America, Inc., prepared at the request of Mr. and Mrs. Beal, the painting was in the collections of Emil Carlsen, Mrs. Emil Carlsen, and Dines Carlsen. This implies that Mrs. Carlsen acquired the painting from her husband (he left his estate entirely to her) and that, in turn, it was acquired by their son.
[3]. The painting was sent from this NYC gallery to Mrs. Beal in care of Carnegie Institute before January 30, 1959 (see relevant correspondence in curatorial file.) According to the appraisal report in note [2], Mr. and Mrs. Beal purchased it on November 24, 1958.

[2]. An agreement was reached between the University of Pennsylvania and the Evans Society in June 1912; the university assumed the responsibility of instruction and the Society erected a new dental building. The new institution was called the Thomas W. Evans Museum and Dental Institute School of Dentistry University of Pennsylvania. It was located on the site of the former Evans estate at the corner of the 40th and Spruce Street and was completed in early 1915. It housed both the Dental School with its new lecture halls, clinics, and laboratories, and the Evans Museum. See Penn-University Archives & Records website under ""School of Dental Medicine: A Brief History.""
