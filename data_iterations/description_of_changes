##First Data Cleaning Session (TMK) 4623

Interesting note about the creation date that I am noting before making a dedicated choice. This is, in fact, the last thing I will do before
handing it off to Michael. For instance, all of the 'late/early century' styles have listed years in the other two columns. this is the main 
item on my to-do list before handing it off. aimming to get as much done tonight as i can. A storm is rolling through... 

MF suggested in a document looking at birth place, but what about death year? just a thought... 

Fun note while exploring: the two name tabs witch the first and last name. However, in Japanese, the name stays the same between the
cited name and the full name. Otherwise, the below decision was arrived to in order to do a comb of the data to make it more manageable in 
future iterations of this project. 

TMK removed the information about the source of how the piece arrived at the museum for the purposes of this project. While future iterations 
can pull from the original file of the CMOA and merge data in this project later, this first iteration is more concerned with the physical and 
digital locations of pieces as they exist according to our understanding of the functions of museums and archives. 

At the end of the Column Removal session, the dates were finally tackled which prompted the opening of OpenRefine. That began the real hard work ahead.

##Second Data Cleaning Session (TMK) 4723

8:36 a.m. Early start right back where I left off: the pesky date columns

10:23 a.m. I'm still on the date columns

10:51 a.m. breaking for storms. about halfway through the date columns. 

11:48 a.m. back and now thinking about the ramifications of the choices I've made in the changes with values including "century." I chose to change the 
values throughout to the range of years in creation date. In the choice, I make the deleted presence of the other two known in the creation date while 
simultaneously eliminating the specificity present in the categories including "centuries" by choosing to go with the numerical. I am reminded of 
Peter Galison's dissection of clocks (time) and maps (space) as i have been consolidating all of the creation dates as numbers without the presence
of words. I am now realizing in hindsight that could be a practice of more precise time periods? It still feels clear through the year ranges that are 
uniform. 

12:09 p.m. slight deviations from the above point would be if the creation date earliest and latest are listed differently than the century ranges. is
that more or less specific? what does that mean? 

12:16 p.m. "c." entries were entered on that, diverging from the throughline of all of year groups. For the purposes of what we are looking at, I went 
with the purposeful choices of those who touched this dataset before. While narrowing it down, it is also giving the indication of the archivist/data 
manager prior to us. 

12:29 p.m. Collar, Row 11828, had years listed opposite to the original century label. 18th century, but 1800s on the other two columns. would someone
have found that without the focus on the numbers and structure of time? who knows! I decided to go with the years listed with the other two columns, which
remained the most accurate estimation of these pieces as I combed through making things unifroms across the board. Later found "Cuffs", Row 12751, being
credited as late 19th century, yet the years say something different——1725-1775, mid sixteenth century. Later AGAIN, Alexander Entering Babylon in Triumph,
Row 9989, as late 17th century with 1099-1198 listed instead. 

The only ones listed with century that I left were prints of Chinese, Japanese, and Pakistani art with two print dates. I was not sure what to do with it!

That's it for what I have in me for OpenRefine at 1:09 p.m. on 4/7. I will return to those dates on a different date. heh. passing on the file to MF.

# Moving Forward
- [To Do] Simplifying Nationality (eliminating repeating in the same value)
- [To-Do] Classification Tab Simplification
- [To-Do] That Scary Medium Column (collaborate)


##Open Refine Cleaning 04/07/23

(3:16PM) Consolidating "nationality" descriptions by eliminating repeating terms in the same value

NOTE: What to do with mixed nationality descriptions like "British|Scottish"? I think we should keep these, 
but what about mixed nationality descriptions with repeating terms like "British|British|Scottish? Perhaps we can consolidate to "British|Scottish"

NOTE: nationality descriptions like "British|British|Scottish" correspond with the names in the "cited_names" column, but
do we need the "cited_names" column at all? Do we intend to talk about any specific artists by name? If not, consider deleting column 

(4:07PM) down to 313 choices total in "nationality" column

(5:22PM) Still working on "nationality" column, removed "creation_date_earliest" and "creation_date_latest" columns

(7:17PM) Finished consolidating "nationality" descriptions by eliminating repeating terms in same value. This leaves 292 choices total. 
I left the mixed nationality descriptions alone for now. 

(7:25PM) Taking a short break to pet my dog because he is smol and is good boi

(7:37PM) Looking at Classification tab to work on simplification, consolidated "mixed media" and "Mixed Media"

(7:53PM) Reveiwed the Classification tab, not sure what else to consolidate here. All of the choices seem distinct to me.
Venturing to the dreaded "medium" column to see if I can make some headway.

(7:54PM) Consolidating various combinations of "ink, pencil, and watercolor on paper."
Consolidating various combinations of "graphite, ink, and watercolor on paper."

(7:57PM) Consolidating "gelatin silver print" category

(8:00PM) Continuing to consolidate simple spelling, punctuation, and capitalization discrepancies similar to "mixed media" and "Mixed Media"

(9:09PM) "medium" column down to 4836 choices. Phew!

##Data Cleaning 04/12/23

(8:30PM) Continuing to clean medium column

##Data Cleaning 04/19/23

(12:26PM) MK finishing the creation date cleaning

- If there is a range of the 'project time' and then a specific date, I went with the range to catch the full time the piece took to make. 
- If two dates were listed (ie. conceived vs. cast or a production date later than the first year listed), I went with the date of creation for the 
  piece itself. (The cast date or a later production, since that seems more specific to the piece) 
- Remaining BCE pieces with ranges have "to" inbetween the range in order to make the years easier to read

(12:59) Row 13067: Had two ranges, most likely from when the wall was built and then when the fragment of the wall (the piece itself) was created.
        The range has changed to reflect the full time from wall to fragment

(1:19PM) It feels weird to clean up the words specifying periods of Dynasties in China and Japan (and the Roman period) 

(1:24) Going for months and cleaning those to just be a number for the year (December was finished with the above, starting at January)
        Row 2656: Plate from the Obama inaugural address (Not on View?) 
(1:28) February (I'm noticing that most of the ones I'm going through with specific months and/or days are Not on View) 
(1:31) Oh god, "ma" shows not just March or May but also 'manufactured.' Taking the same as above, I'm going for the creation of the piece itself
        It's all furniture. Furniture all the way down on the 'manufactured'
(1:40) June and July 
       At this point, I began to realize that a lot of this stuff is coming from the Teenie Harris archive. this explains the 'not on view' for a majority 
       of this cleaning today
(1:51) August
(1:54) September
    A revision came up, so I am going with the revision date for the same reason as manufactured and printed decisions above
(1:56) October
(1:59) November
      AND ANOTHER REVELATION IN "no earlier than [YEAR]" Every time I think I'm about to climb out, it pulls me right back in. Year listed has been chosen
      Leaving 'no date' as a possibility especially since most of these are also on 'not on view'
      After conferring with group, I've changed these to "NULL"
(2:13) December
(2:14) Now cleaning things that came up throughout, such as: "revision" "block" "reprint" "drawn" "project" "before" "retouched"
      "Before" made me revisit older versions of the data to get the range more accurate (paused to do the rest) 
      Rework and Retouch are going based on the last date listed (view as completed) 
      "Dynasty" has been cleaned up 
(2:26) "c." is gonna kill me, I guess I have to look up some Open Refine tutorials again
(2:29) Going back to finish "Before" by comparing to other datasets (Specifically, 4_6, a version I saved before the above cleaning)
(2:44) Back to "c." after cleaning "ca." and "cast" 
      https://kb.refinepro.com/2011/07/remove-specific-character-in-column.html THIS WEBSITE SAVED SO MUCH TIME. 
(2:50) UGH Thought I was done, but putting 'n' showed another 259 cells with still more text 
      "Print" "Designed" and "patent" were the main culprits in this last search; again, most recent date was chosen to be specific to the object
      Weird, most of these reprints are ALSO not on view
      "Late Qing" were collectively changed to 1800-1911; the dataset puts them all at 1777, which is only halfway through the Qing Period (ended in 1912)
      the above tutorial has made some of this so much easier ("printed posthumously" was complicated, so a mass transform helped"
(3:03) my mind really said "lemme type each letter" and so I began the final combing by starting at "a" which brought 80 cells
       It was here I realized I forgot "April" above 
(3:09) Moving onto "b" and onward, will report once a big amount comes through
(3:13) "s" found me with the [YEARS]s with 371 cells, so I'm saving this until I get through the rest of the alphabet
(3:15) tackling the last stuff: the above "s" with 371 cells
(3:21) MK Signing off on the "Creation Year" column

I'm out
