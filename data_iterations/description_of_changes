#The following chronicles changes to an original dataset of the Carnegie Museum of Art, found at the following link: https://github.com/cmoa/collection
    
##First Data Cleaning Session (TMK) 45623

Interesting note about the creation date that I am noting before making a dedicated choice. This is, in fact, the last thing I will do before
handing it off to Michael. For instance, all of the 'late/early century' styles have listed years in the other two columns. this is the main 
item on my to-do list before handing it off. aimming to get as much done tonight as i can. A storm is rolling through... 

MF suggested in a document looking at birth place, but what about death year? just a thought... 

Fun note while exploring: the two name tabs witch the first and last name. However, in Japanese, the name stays the same between the
cited name and the full name. Otherwise, the below decision was arrived to in order to do a comb of the data to make it more manageable in 
future iterations of this project. 

TMK removed the information about the source of how the piece arrived at the museum for the purposes of this project. While future iterations 
can pull from the original file of the CMOA and merge data in this project later, this first iteration is more concerned with the physical and 
digital locations of pieces as they exist according to our understanding of the functions of museums and archives. 

At the end of the Column Removal session, the dates were finally tackled which prompted the opening of OpenRefine. That began the real hard work ahead
